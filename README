Parse::GEDA::Gschem version 1.0.0

NAME

    Parse::GEDA::Gschem - gEDA/gaf gschem schematic file parser


DESCRIPTION

    Collection of routines used to parse and write back schematic files of the
    format specified by gEDA gschem schematic capture tool as detailed at:
    http://www.geda.seul.org/wiki/geda:file_format_spec


REQUIREMENTS:
    perl 5.10


EXAMPLE:
    my @schFiles = (); # array of schematic file path/names
    my @files = ();    # array of schematic objects
    bakSchFiles(\@schFiles); # backup schematic files in bak/year-m-d_h-m-s/
    $files = @{readSchFiles(\@schFiles)}; # parses the schematic files
    writeMsg(1, Dumper(\@files)); # prints out the entire data structure
    writeSchFiles(\@files); # write the data structure into schematic files

    Parse::gaf::gschem is a collection of routines used to parse a .sch file
    into a convenient perl array of hashes data structure in memory.
    This array can then be used to extract information about the schematics,
    or it can be altered to apply specific changes to the schematics.
    The array can then be written back to the schematic files.
    One could even build such array of hashes data structure without reading
    any input schematic file to programmatically generate new schematic files.


LIMITATIONS

    * Does not fetch data from the sym file referenced in the sch file.
      I.e. the data structure created is only as deep as the sch file itself,
      if a symbol is instantiated as a reference in the sch file then only the
      attributes also instantiated in that sch file will be present in the
      data structure. In other words, the referenced sym file in the symbol
      library path is never accessed, only the schematic files are accessed.
